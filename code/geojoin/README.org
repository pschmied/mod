* Make comparisons across datasets containing geometric data
Initial version only compares point geometries in a sane
way. Comparisons are made between PostGIS tables containing columns
containing geometries.

Script allows for some sensitivity analysis based on distance between
points, as few points would be expected to match perfectly. Matches
are instead based on a distance threshold (i.e. a match would occur
when a point is within X units of distance of a point in a
corresponding table).
